Almost a week overdue, I believe I have done enough in the last week to finally warrant a blog post! FlatIron reluctantly took a back seat over Christmas and New Years, but with my second project on the horizon I knew it was going to take a lot of effort to catch up.

Progress was good, but every now and then you get thrown a curve ball, and the Playlister lesson was exactly that.  The negative side of me looked through the objectives to see methods I had forgotten about and had to re-learn, but the big plus was that I would be much more knowledgeable after completing it.


An important aspect which helped me greatly was to map out everything in whatever way you can to make it stick. I wrote all the tables out in my notebook and made sure my understanding of all the relations were solid. Then once I had created all my migrations/models and reminded myself how to parse data to seed the database, I was free to create the views.


Overall, the Playlister lesson has really solidified my understanding, and made the next lesson 'NYC' a lot more enjoyable to complete.  The next step...final project!
