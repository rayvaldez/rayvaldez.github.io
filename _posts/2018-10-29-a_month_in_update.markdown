So just over a month in and I recieve an email about preparing for my first CLI project. Whilst I am hugely excited to take on this project to apply what I have learned and create something tailored to my interests, the last few lessons in the curriculum have been very challenging. From metaprogramming, to custom errors and nested (pretty much) everythings, there is a great deal thrown at you before you can even attempt to think about ideas for your CLI.   

I hope that somewhere deep in my brain, this tidle wave of information is sticking!  


A few more labs and I get to tackle this project head on...
