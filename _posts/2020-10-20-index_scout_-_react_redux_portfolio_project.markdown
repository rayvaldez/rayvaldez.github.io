You could say I've gone absolutely football mad during my time in Flatiron. Four out of five projects completely related to football...

But this is the one thing that I have always relied on to provide me with that one idea for each project requirement, that I could mould and adapt to be different (ok...to an extent...) from other projects. It solidifies the ideology that sticking to something you know will always open up creative ideas for your apps.

### So what have I created?

I read a lot of news regarding European Football in general, and I get nagged by people for my advice regarding a Footballer Stockmarket Website called Football Index. So to aid in being as efficient/lazy as possible, I decided to code a message board/ forum application to pass down all my golden nuggets to future investors in the stockmarket.

Users are able to sift through 'scout reports' posted by knowledgeable reporters, or if they feel up to the challenge, to come up with their own report on a Player.

### What if you dont have time to browse through these reports?

No problem, I have also added a badge voting system to identify key attributes of a player.

The 5 buttons on the bottom are the attributes you can vote a player to have, and I have placed a rudimentary counter display for demonstrations sake. When a counter passes 5 votes, a badge is displayed by the players attributes.

### What next?

The next piece of functionality would be to allow Users to create Players if they do not already exist. 

### Conclusion

This project has opened my eyes to how powerful the React library is and how quick and efficient it can be to produce User Interfaces. Although I have completed my project, I do feel I still need to reinforce my knowledge and I am eager to build an app to push the boundaries further.
