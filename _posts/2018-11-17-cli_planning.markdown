Okay, so right now I am not anywhere near where I wanted to be. I did stuggle taking in all the lessons before the CLI project, and to add to that I have been on holiday for a week, a week which at first I thought I could continue studying while I was away.

That didn't happen.

But thankfully, it did give me some time away to stand back and gather my thoughts about it all. I re-read quite a few of the lessons, watched a lot of tutorials and googled a ton, which has started to make it all connect. Although it has taken a lot of time and set me back, I know you just have to look at the bigger picture and the end goal!

I knew I had in mind a few ideas for my CLI Gem, and the one that stood out was about football player ratings. So I went in search of a few websites that wouldn't be too hard to scrape data from, and I found one that enabled me to scrape 4 different types of data.

So my FifaTop100 will be based on the top 100 players rated on fifa 2019, where I can scrape the name, team, rank and short description of a player. Let's see how this goes...
