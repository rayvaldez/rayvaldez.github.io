"Yes! It's finally broken!". 

Whilst most kids would quickly discard their no longer functioning toys, I developed a real obsession of grabbing screwdrivers out of my Dads toolbox and sitting down, carefully taking apart the toy I enjoyed for a long period of time. I no longer wanted to play with a toy but was rather curious to know what actually went in to making one. For some toys I was able to seek out the motor, or the LEDs and others I had to settle for a circuit board, which for a 10 year old was a totally different world I couldn't access.

Fast forward a few more years and I get a really big toy, my car! Little did I know this would inspire me to become a Mechanical Service Technician. In addition to this, I was also studying IT in University, developing my coding knowledge and expanding the scope of my interests. My curiousity in younger years had served me well and I thought to myself "I am pretty good at problem solving!". 

Which leads me on to the present. I didn't complete University, and went completely off track of programming. I caught up with a friend, who a year previous had told me he had joined a programming bootcamp. He updated me on the success of his course and the result of it, a job in Central London with a well known company.  This was the kick up the backside I had needed, my friend had no experience whatsoever, which made me question what was stopping me? Having always said to myself I will jump back on it someday, I have finally bit the bullet. A lot has changed since I
first started learning, but becomming proficient in programming will allow me to play with the biggest toys of all.
